`

The app is also hosted on `shinyapps.io`, availible here: [Tick Pathogen] (https://kevin-ewing.shinyapps.io/FinalTickPathogen/?_ga=2.9225404.882168004.1625698303-236520040.1612454939)

Please be patient as the apps load when run locally and on `shinyapps.io`. The `.geojson` files and data may take time to populate the maps.
